# autoflash-nexus-5x

My tiny update script for my phone

Because doing it manually got annoying

## What does it do?

Download, install and update:
 - Latest vendor image
 - Latest TWRP
 - Latest LineageOS
 - Latest F-Droid privileged OTA
 - Latest addon su for LinageOS
 - Latest OpenGApps pico

Note that the last 4 items get updated by doing a full re-flash of the system partion (takes longer than just flashing them individually, but this keeps the system partion cleaner)

## Why publish?

Some people may find it useful for themselves.

Tested on my nexus 5x. More devices likely NOT being added.
